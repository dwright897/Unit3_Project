1. The base case is going to be set by how small we want it to go/length of the branches, the recursive case is when it has not run enough times and will continue to run. 


2. It will need the branch length, the angle, and the depth. the branch length, as it will stop once the branches get to small. 


3. 1. Write the recursion to create a base(trunk) and two equally sized branches on each side. 
   2. define and implement angle rotation. make sure branch lengths decrease, and branches are drawn symmetrically
   3.add functionality to adjust branch thickness based on length/depth of branches.
